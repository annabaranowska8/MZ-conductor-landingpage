  "biography": "Martyna Zych is a conductor focused on Czech music. In the 2023/2024 season, she is the resident conductor in Olsztyn Philharmonic. She is a co-founder and originator of the Orchestra for Refugees Musicians from Ukraine.\n\nThe artist thoroughly studies the works of Czech composers, collaborating with a lot of  orchestras in the Czech Republic and the Antonín Dvořák's and Bedřich Smetana's Museum in Prague. She wrote many analytical works based on manuscripts: comparing editions, letters and history. During the work with Czech repertoire, she cares primarily about the performance truth, in line with the composer's intentions and the tradition of his country.\n\nIn 2022, she made her debut with the Bohuslav Martinů Philharmonic in Zlín during the Talentinum Festival and with the Karlovy Vary Symphony Orchestra opening season 2022/2023. Martyna Zych was selected to actively participate in conducting masterclasses with Marin Alsop and NOSPR in Katowice. The year 2023 started with intensive work and trips, including: the international conducting competition in Budapest, taking part in rehearsals and concerts of the Bamberger Symphoniker and conducting debut with the Polish Orchestra Sinfonia Iuventus with Má vlast by B. Smetana. At the beginning of September she  will represent Poland during the Ferenc Fricsay conducting competition in Hungary.\n\nAs an assistant she cooperated with: Theater and Philharmonic in Pilsen, Kalisz Philharmonic, Rzeszów Philharmonic. She could expand knowledge of traditional practice, history and Czech folklore during the meetings with personalities, including: Jakub Hrůša, Veronika Vejvodová and Zuzana Rzounkova.\n\nMartyna Zych is an active violist, working in the Polish Sinfonia Iuventus Orchestra.",
