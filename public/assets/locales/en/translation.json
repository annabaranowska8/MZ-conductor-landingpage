    "biography": "Martyna Zych is an ambitious Polish conductor focused on Czech music. She studied symphony and opera conducting at the Fryderyk Chopin University of Music in Warsaw in the class of prof. Tomasz Bugaj and the viola in the class of prof. Piotr Reichert. The ambition mentioned at the very beginning can be seen in her conducting activity: she is the originator and co-founder of the first in Poland Orchestra of Musicians-Refugees from Ukraine. Their premiere concert took place on 3 April 2022 in Rzeszów and was so successful, that within a month the orchestra performed three more concerts all over Poland. Soon after, Martyna Zych was selected to take an active part in the conductor's masterclasses with Marin Alsop and NOSPR in Katowice, and a week later she made her debut with the Bohuslav Martinů Philharmonic in Zlín during the Talentinum Festival. She was also invited to open the artistic season 2022/2023 of the Karlovy Vary Symphony Orchestra with a full Czech program. The year 2023 began with intensive work and journeys, including: the international conducting competition in Budapest, taking part in rehearsals and concerts of the Bamberger Symphoniker (thanks to the invitation of the chiefconductor Jakub Hrůša) and conducting debut with the Polish Sinfonia Iuventus Orchestra with Má vlast by B. Smetana Thanks to cooperation with the Antonín Dvořák Museum in Prague she has faksimile to works by Antonín Dvořák (including Symphony No. 9 in E minor, Op. 95, Symphony No. 4 in D minor, Op. 13). She wrote many analytical works about Czech composers; comparing scores with manuscripts, letters and history. During the work with the Czech repertoire, she is primarily concerned with the truth of performance, in accordance with the composer&#39;s intentions and the tradition of his country. Many times she was an assistant to Polish and foreign conductors, including Jiří Petrdlík, Chuhei Iwasaki, Massimiliano Caldi. As an assistant, she had an opportunity to learn about many traditions of works by Czech composers and increase her knowledge during meetings with: Jakub Hrůša, Veronika Vejvodová and Tomáš Brauner. In addition, Martyna speaks fluently Czech, so she can easily collaborate with Czech soloists. As a violist in the Polish Orchestra Sinfonia Iuventus has the opportunity to work with outstanding conductors on a wide repertoire from the practical and performance point of view. She is a person full of energy who wants to convey her sincere passion to orchestral musicians and spread the performance truth of Czech music.",

    "quote": "Her maturation, although still nearing completion given her young age, is very fast and I am sure that in few years she could achieve very significant results.",
